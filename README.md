## Usage

This webpage has been organised into four different sections, each section relating to a different coding platform, either: HTML, CSS, Git or JavaScript. In each section is a bullet pointed list with some notes on how to use each topic. 
In order to see the JavaScript running, the DevTools console can be opened by right clicking the web page and selecting inspect. The JavaScript will show all of the topics that have been learnt during the prework and will suggest a topic to be studied first.
